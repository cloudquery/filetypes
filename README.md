# CloudQuery FileTypes

The CloudQuery FileTypes module is a shared library used by some of our [destination plugins](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/plugins/destinations/overview) to format data in a designated format (e.g. JSON, CSV).

It's meant to be used internally by CloudQuery plugins and not designed to be publicly consumed by other projects.
